We're reaching out to let you know that, as announced last year, we have officially begun requiring users who contribute code on GitHub.com to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.

Your account meets this criteria, and you will need to enroll in 2FA within 45 days, by November 14th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC). After this date, your access to GitHub.com will be limited until you enroll in 2FA. Enrolling is easy, and we support several options, starting with TOTP apps and text messages (SMS) and then adding on passkeys and the GitHub Mobile app.

Click here to enroll in 2FA.

Making the software supply chain more secure is a team effort, and we can't do it without you. Your enrollment in 2FA is an impactful step in keeping the world's software secure. If you want to learn more about this change, please take a look at our documentation about the program.

To see this and other security events for your account, visit your account security audit log.

If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting the GitHub support page.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
